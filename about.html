        The UMW-ISCA is an international student association for cardiology that aims to provide students
            an opportunity to partake in various research like meta-analyses, case studies, sytemic reviews,
            as well as clinical rotations, and student-led presentations.

        <p class="content-paragraph">
            Joining UMW-ISCA is a great way to gain a controlled exposure to clinical setting in cardiology for all
            levels and all years. It also provides a strong foundation for learning ECGs, resusitation, and a 
            comprehensive understanding of hemodynamics that are crucial for patient managment in many specialities.

                UMW-ISCA is working very closely with the cardiology research club and the Polish branch 
                of the European society of Cardiology (ESC). We hold attend and hold confrences, where students
                present research to a commitee of staff member who supervise research and provide critical analyses
                and reccomendations.
