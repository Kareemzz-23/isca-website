        <p class="content-paragraph">
            The UMW-ISCA is an international student association for cardiology that aims to provide students
            an opportunity to partake in various research like meta-analyses, case studies, systemic reviews,
            as well as clinical rotations, and student-led presentations.
        </p>

        <h4 class="content-heading">What can we offer you?</h4>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            Joining UMW-ISCA is a great way to gain controlled exposure to clinical settings in cardiology for all
            levels and all years. It also provides a strong foundation for learning ECGs, resuscitation, and a 
            comprehensive understanding of hemodynamics that are crucial for patient management in many specialties.

        <p class="content-paragraph">
            UMW-ISCA is working very closely with the cardiology research club and the Polish branch 
            of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). We attend and hold conferences, where students
            present research to a committee of staff members who supervise research and provide critical analyses
            and recommendations.

        <h4 class="content-heading">The team</h4>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            Apart from being a place where medical students can take part in research, attend conferences, shadow 
            on-duty cardiologists, and develop an interest and prowess in cardiology, UMW-ISCA is a great place to
            meet like-minded, ambitious, and friendly medical students who are happy to guide new members through
            some of the learning and activities. UMW-ISCA meetings have a great atmosphere, and joining UMW-ISCA
            is a massive opportunity for medical students to enjoy their studies and benefit from them.
